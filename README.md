# Physics III Laboratory Experiments

## Overview
This repository contains the laboratory experiments performed in Physics III. 
Each experiment is organized in its own folder, including the experimental data, analysis notebooks, and an individual README explaining the procedure and results.

The purpose of these experiments is to apply theoretical physics concepts through practical measurements, data collection, and data analysis.

## Experiments Included
- **Experiment 1:** [Name/Topic]  
  A brief description of the experiment’s objective.

- **Experiment 2:** Capacitor Charging  
  Analysis of the electric charge-voltage relationship to determine the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor at different plate separations.  
  See `Experiment-2-Capacitor/README.md` for full details.

- **Experiment 3:** [Name/Topic]  
  A brief description of the experiment’s objective.

*(Additional experiments can be added following the same structure.)*

## Repository Structure
Each experiment folder includes:
- `README.md` – a short explanation of the experiment, objectives, and methodology  
- `*.ipynb` – Jupyter/Colab notebooks with data analysis and visualization  
- `*.xlsx` or `*.csv` – raw experimental data files

## Tools and Methods
- Python 3
- Jupyter / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Linear regression and basic data analysis techniques

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook of the experiment you want to explore in Google Colab or Jupyter.  
2. Ensure the data file (`.xlsx` or `.csv`) is available in the folder.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce plots and calculations.
